      # In the context of a health check:
      #   * It behaves like a web crawler (spider): it sends a request to the URL (http://localhost:3000/) to verify connectivity.
      #   * If the server responds (e.g., with a 200 OK), wget returns a success exit code (0).
      #   * It discards the content instead of saving an index.html file to the container's disk every 30 seconds, which keeps the container clean.
